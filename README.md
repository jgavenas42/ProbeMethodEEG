# ProbeMethodEEG
Repo for analysis of behavior &amp; EEG data from Gavenas et al. (2025) in Imaging Neuroscience. 

Scripts for conducting analysis and plotting results for figures 2 (behavior), 3 (ERPs), 4 (modeling), 5 & 6 (time-frequency) are contained. Some of the dataframes (e.g. all preprocessed data before grand-averaging) are too large for github, please contact us if you would like this data. Furthermore, we may use different terminology to refer to the different conditions in the code. Generally, Hit = Prep trials and Miss = No Prep trials, the rest should be self-explanatory.
